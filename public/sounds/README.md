# Sound Files for Relax Mode

This directory should contain the following calming spa-like music files for the rocks:

## Required Sound Files:

1. **chime-high.mp3** - High-pitched calming chime sound for small rocks
2. **chime-mid.mp3** - Mid-pitched calming chime sound for medium rocks
3. **chime-low.mp3** - Low-pitched calming chime sound for large rocks

## Sound Specifications:

- **Format**: MP3
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds recommended
- **Style**: Calming, spa-like, meditation sounds (e.g., singing bowls, soft chimes, gentle bells)
- **Volume**: The application will dynamically adjust volume based on impact velocity

## Recommendations:

For a truly relaxing experience, consider using:
- Tibetan singing bowl sounds
- Crystal bowl chimes
- Soft wind chimes
- Gentle meditation bells
- Water droplet sounds

## Fallback:

If these files are not present, the RelaxMode component will work without sound, focusing purely on the visual physics experience.
